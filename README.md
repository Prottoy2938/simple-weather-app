This is a small weather application which runs on Nodejs, And its dynamic.
I have used hbs framework for its dynamic content.

The code that I have used in this project, learned (!taken) from an nodejs course. Thanks to Andrew Mead for helping me create this.

If you look want to go deeper into the code and use this, you have to change the api key both in geocode.js and forecast.js.
